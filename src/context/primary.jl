    unsafe_reset!(pctx::CuPrimaryContext, [checked::Bool=true])

Explicitly destroys and cleans up all resources associated with a device's primary context
in the current process. Note that this forcibly invalidates all contexts derived from this
primary context, and as a result outstanding resources might become invalid.

It is normally unnecessary to call this function, as resource are automatically freed when
contexts go out of scope. In the case of primary contexts, they are collected when all
contexts derived from that primary context have gone out of scope.

The `checked` argument determines whether to verify that the primary context has become
inactive after resetting the derived driver contexts. This may not be possible, eg. if the
CUDA runtime API itself has retained an additional context instance.
